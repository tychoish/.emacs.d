;;
;; EXPERIMENTAL AND ONLY INTENDED FOR ADVANCED USERS
;;
;; Helper functions to produce a port of the currently
;; enabled Modus theme (`modus-operandi' or `modus-vivendi') for various
;; terminal emulators or text editors outside the Emacs milieu.
;;
;; Insofar as external text editors are concerned, such ports are not
;; meant to be treated as 'official themes'.  This is a mere facility to
;; approximate the surface-level aesthetics of the Modus themes: a real
;; theme requires attention to detail; a requirement that no generic
;; template can satisfy.
;;
;; Consult the doc string of `modus-themes-exporter-export' for how to
;; use this library.
;;
;; Also read "Introducing the Modus themes exporter (Emacs library)":
